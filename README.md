# PHP-Class-User-Permission-Handling
Very simple and basic PHP class for handling user credentials in web applications (logging in and out)

Please note that this class and code are not meant to be used in production! It was written in order to have a very quick and simple solution for development and testing.

You might consider using libraries like UserFrosting, UserSprice or components from existing PHP frameworks right from the start of your project.
